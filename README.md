# make-deps
There are two know bugs right now ;)

1. `trivy` is always downloaded. Make somehow doesnt recognize a download is not needed. For `kubectl` and `yq` make only downloads them if they are missing or the `.deps/*.yaml` config file has been changed (working: `make deps-working` and delete binaries or change version in `.deps/*.yaml`, not working: `make deps` and trivy gets downloaded every time) I guess I have to read up on how `make` determines if a file has changed... 
2. Automatic generation: As the targets are pretty similar (for now not looking at `tar.gz` case, but there is an easy solution for that ;). I would love to generate the targets based on a list. You can see this partially working (`make test-gen`), but sadly right now the ory cli is not exectued...
